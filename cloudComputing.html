          generally used to describe data centers available to many
          users over the Internet. Large clouds, predominant today, often have functions distributed over multiple locations from central servers. If the connection to the user is relatively close, it may be designated an edge server.</p>
        <p>Clouds may be limited to a single organization (enterprise clouds), or be available to many organizations (public cloud).</p>
        <p>Cloud computing relies on sharing of resources to achieve coherence and economies of scale.</p>

          <p>Advocates of public and hybrid clouds note that cloud computing allows companies to avoid or minimize up-front IT infrastructure costs. Proponents also claim that cloud computing allows enterprises to get their applications up and
            running
            faster, with improved manageability and less maintenance, and that it enables IT teams to more rapidly adjust resources to meet fluctuating and unpredictable demand.[2][3][4] Cloud providers typically use a "pay-as-you-go" model, which
            can
            lead to unexpected operating expenses if administrators are not familiarized with cloud-pricing models.</p>
          <p>The availability of high-capacity networks, low-cost computers and storage devices as well as the widespread adoption of hardware virtualization, service-oriented architecture and autonomic and utility computing has led to growth in
            cloud
            computing.By 2019, Linux was the most widely used operating system, including in Microsoft's offerings and is thus described as dominant.[9] The Cloud Service Provider (CSP) will screen, keep up and gather data about the firewalls,
            Intrusion identification or/and counteractive action frameworks and information stream inside the network.</p>

        <p>Private cloud is cloud infrastructure operated solely for a single organization, whether managed internally or by a third party, and hosted either internally or externally.</p>

        <p>A cloud is called a "public cloud" when the services are rendered over a network that is open for public use</p>

        <h2>Hybrid cloud</h2>
        <p>Hybrid cloud is a composition of a public cloud and a private environment, such as a private cloud or on-premise resources,that remain distinct entities but are bound together, offering the benefits of multiple deployment models.</p>
